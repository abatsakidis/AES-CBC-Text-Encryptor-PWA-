AES CBC Text Encryptor (PWA)

This is a lightweight Progressive Web App (PWA) built with HTML, JavaScript, and CryptoJS that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the AES encryption algorithm in CBC mode with SHA-256 password hashing. It supports:

*    AES encryption/decryption in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding
*   Password-based key derivation using SHA-256
*    Random IV generation per encryption
*   Saving encrypted/decrypted results as .txt files
*    Loading input text from files
*    Offline functionality via service worker (PWA support)

Ideal for simple text protection tasks that can run entirely in the browser, even without internet access.
